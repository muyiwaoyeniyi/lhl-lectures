## React Hooks
- `useState` (managing data that may change)
- `useEffect` (side effects that occur on data change or initial load of component)

## Custom Hooks
We can break out our business logic from our component, reducing bloat in component and giving us a way to re-use functionality from component to component.

Note how much smaller are components become as we break out complex pieces into separate hooks. They get to be separate, specialized, and it gives us the opportunity to make much of our code more re-usable!

## Important to Note
- All custom hook *names* should start with the word `use`, see our `useFetch`, `useLocalStorage`, and `useLogChanges` as examples
- Always look for ways to make the custom hook as re-usable as possible, if you're careful you can use a custom hook across many components or even projects
- Any instances of `useState` and `useEffect` are unique to each calling of the custom hook, lending well to this idea of re-usability
- We are free to use `document` API, `eventListener`s, and React's very own `useState` and `useEffect` to our advantage in custom hooksâ˜ºmake the most of them!

```js
// simple custom hook
const useDocumentTitle = (title) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = title;
  }, [title]);
};

// inside of a component
useDocumentTitle('My New Title');
```
