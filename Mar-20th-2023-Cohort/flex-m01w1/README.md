## Curriculum Overview

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_NWYcPhS6Q3hQKXnh09Eufl7hs45yBLbUBZhWyvqeSc/edit#slide=id.ge52f3d8942_0_74

## Lecture plan

- Zoom.
  - Link will be posted on Discord a few minutes before lecture time
  - Video if you can
  - 10 min break on the hour mark
  - Ask questions. Drop in the chat box. Use the shortcuts (ALT-Y to raise your hand, Spacebar to unmute yourself)
  - Don't code along or be distracted with other activities
- Lecture notes/videos will be uploaded and accessible via Compass
- Theory plus live coding
- Breakouts sometimes

## Advice

- Pace yourself
  - Practice
- Ask questions. Leverage LHL mentor and instructor network. Office hours etc
- Ask Google
- Seek to understand why or how?
  - Developers are problem solvers
  - Step by step incremental development
- Conceptualize the solution or process before you code. Pseudocode etc
- Keep going and never give up

## Tools

- OS
- VM Ex. WSL preferred. Vagrant (non-m1 macs). VirtualBox.
- IDEs Ex. VS Code etc. Useful addons -- Ex. Better Comments, endwise (Ruby), ESLint, Prettier - Code formatter, GitLens
- Terminal
- Git/Github
  - Why?
  - Most common commands
    - git status
    - git add .
    - git commit -m "message"
    - git remote -v (or add origin, rm origin)
    - git push
    - git pull
- Documentation/Stack Overflow/Tech blogs Ex. (https://dev.to/, https://hackernoon.com/, https://news.ycombinator.com/)
- Mentors/Instructors/Cohort

## Exercise

- Write a node program that takes in an unlimited number of command line arguments, goes through each and prints out the sum of them. If any argument is not a whole number, skip it. Do support negative numbers though. If any argument is not a number, output an error message. We need at least 2 arguments.

* **DO** outline process/requirments
* **DO** format (indent and space) your code as you go.
    * This makes it easier to read and understand what's happening (or what's broken).
* **DO** use functions to do small units of work
    * This makes it easier to read and understand what's happening (or what's broken).
* **DON'T** copy/paste from other code.
    * Try to understand and type it out yourself!
* **DON'T** skip error messages.
    * Errors can be your 'friend'. They may look confusing or intimidating but they're your friend! Try to understand what they are saying and avoid guessing.
* **DO** take time to understand your code.
    * you can use tools like [JavaScript Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/javascript.html#mode=edit) to help you understand what happens and when.


### What to do when you're stuck (or don't understand something)
1. Do your own research first!
    * Google is your friend and learning how to search for answers is a *very* valuable skill.
    * Spend some time this week (and the rest of the program) learning how to find answers online.
    * Prioritize search results from MDN (for JavaScript) and StackOverflow first and try to take the time to understand what they're telling you.
2. Ask for help!
    * 15m rule — if you're stuck (ie. not making progress) for more than 15m as for mentor support
    * Tell mentors what is not working and what you've tried — (don't just say "it's not working")
